Klepto-chan is a simple webcrawler, originally designed to scour Danbooru-style
image boards, downloading images when direct links weren't provided on the 
gallery pages. After a number of re-writes, the current interface and the HTML
parser have been isolated, theoretically making Klepto-chan capable of combing
ANY website and downloading ANY content the user wants.

Currently, this versatility can only be accomplished by writing a custom parser
class, modifying some code, and then recompiling, but in the future I hope to
make the parser plugin-based, which would allow users to create and share site
parsers, and swap them on the fly.

Other planned features include a preferences editor (instead of needing to
recompile), a download queue (for multiple sites), and right-click access to
the freshly downloaded files and the directory they were downloaded to. For now
though, all focus is on removing bugs and improving download speeds.
