Gnabber is a simple webcrawler written in Java. Technically, it is capable of
downloading any kind of file on any website, limited only by its page parser.

Currently though, this versatility can only be accomplished by writing a custom
parser class, modifying some code in the core, and then recompiling, but in the
future I hope to make the parser plugin-based, which would allow users to create
and share site parsers, and swap them on the fly.

Other planned features include a preferences editor (instead of needing to
recompile), a download queue (for multiple sites), and right-click access to
the freshly downloaded files and the directory they were downloaded to. For now
though, all focus is on removing bugs and improving download speeds.
